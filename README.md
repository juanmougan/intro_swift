# Introduction to Swift Programming: some practice playgrounds

This is a reference of some playground files I'll be creating when completing [University of Toronto's Swift Course that can be found in Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/swift-programming/).   
Most of the code examples will be extracted from the course's videos, and some other will be my own *invention*, but in any cases, it's just meaningless code, that can be used as a quick language reference.
